# Creating 3D Surface Plots in Plotly

This work is part of a current article I am working on, which extends a previous [article](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2018.02342/full) by incorporating a temperature factor. Here, I plot the blood parameters as a function of time and temperature in 3D using plotly.
